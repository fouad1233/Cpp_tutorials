## String Length

Take a look to get_array_size.cpp .

The size of `cars[0]` does not change when you change the string in it because `sizeof` returns the size of the `std::string` object itself, not the size of the string content it manages. The `std::string` class in C++ uses dynamic memory allocation to store its content, and this dynamically allocated memory is not included in the result of `sizeof`.

### Understanding `std::string` and `sizeof`

When you declare a `std::string`, the object itself contains:

1. A pointer to the dynamically allocated memory where the actual characters of the string are stored.
2. The size of the string.
3. The capacity of the string (how much memory is allocated).

The `sizeof` operator applied to a `std::string` object will give you the size of this structure, which is typically the size of the pointers and size variables within the object. This size is fixed and does not depend on the length of the string it manages.

### Example

Consider the following code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    string cars[5] = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda", "Tesla"};
  
    cout << "Size of cars[0] = " << sizeof(cars[0]) << endl;

    cars[0] = "A much longer string than before";
    cout << "Size of cars[0] after changing the string = " << sizeof(cars[0]) << endl;
  
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Output

1. **Initial Size of `cars[0]`:**

   ```cpp
   cout << "Size of cars[0] = " << sizeof(cars[0]) << endl;
   ```

   This will output the size of the `std::string` object, which is typically the same regardless of the string content. Let's assume the output is `24` bytes.
2. **After Changing the String:**

   ```cpp
   cars[0] = "A much longer string than before";
   cout << "Size of cars[0] after changing the string = " << sizeof(cars[0]) << endl;
   ```

   The `sizeof(cars[0])` will still output `24` bytes. This is because the size of the `std::string` object itself has not changed; only the dynamically allocated memory it points to has changed.

### Internal Representation

Here is a simplified representation of a `std::string` object:

```cpp
class std::string {
    char* data;    // Pointer to the actual string data
    size_t size;   // Current length of the string
    size_t capacity; // Allocated memory size
};
```

When you use `sizeof(std::string)`, it returns the size of this structure, which is fixed and does not depend on the string content. The actual string data is stored in memory that the `data` pointer points to, and this memory is allocated dynamically.

### Conclusion

The `sizeof` operator gives the size of the `std::string` object itself, which includes pointers and other metadata, not the size of the string content. Therefore, changing the string content does not change the result of `sizeof(cars[0])` because the structure of the `std::string` object remains the same. The actual memory used to store the string content is dynamically allocated and managed internally by the `std::string` class.
